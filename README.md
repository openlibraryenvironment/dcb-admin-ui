## Welcome

Welcome to DCB Admin! DCB Admin is a Knowledge Integration application and is part of the wider Direct Consortial Borrowing project. It is designed to help people administrate instances of DCB.

You can find the DCB Service repository [here](https://gitlab.com/knowledge-integration/libraries/dcb-service) and more information [here](https://openlibraryfoundation.atlassian.net/l/cp/67Q16M0Q). 

DCB Admin is written in TypeScript using Next.js 13.5.2 and React 18. [Material UI](https://mui.com/) v5 has also been used within the project to deliver a dynamic, themable and resillient modern user interface.

This project conforms to the [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) accessibilty guidelines. If you would like to experience DCB Admin in dark mode, please set your system settings accordingly.

## How to get started

## Contributing

DCB Admin uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs) for code formatting. Please install the Prettier extension in your editor and, if using VS Code, set Prettier as your default formatter and enable 'format on save'. If you're having issues, you may need to do Ctrl-Shift-P, open your user settings, and ensure Prettier is set as `editor.defaultFormatter` and that `editor.formatOnSave` is also enabled.
